**Web Proxy** is a free HTTP-only proxy that enables access to websites that
might have been blocked by your internet provider. It also enables you to
bypass any maximum file size rectriction imposed by your internet provider.

The objective is to be able to monitor the proxy while it operates and be
able to control it to a certain extent.
